## Overview

Workday Planner JS is a small program to help organize your workday. It creates time-blocks from 9am-5pm and saves the text you enter to localStorage.

If the time has passed, then the time-block will be grey. The time block will turn red when the current hour matches the correct time-block. The time block will be green when the time-block is in the future.
